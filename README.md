# Speech to Text for Transcription Services

This project demonstrates how to convert speech audio files into text using automatic speech recognition (ASR) techniques. It is designed to support transcription services by providing an efficient pipeline for processing audio data.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `project_1_Speech_to_Text_for_transcription_services.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code, step-by-step explanations, and outputs.
- (You may add any additional files like `requirements.txt`, datasets, models, or output folders here.)

## üîç Features

- Load and process `.wav` audio files
- Convert speech to text using ASR models (e.g., via Hugging Face's `transformers` or `torchaudio`)
- Visualize waveform and spectrogram
- Output transcription results

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- `torchaudio`
- `transformers`
- `librosa`
- `matplotlib`
- `IPython.display` for audio playback

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speech-to-text-transcription.git
cd speech-to-text-transcription
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If a `requirements.txt` file is not available, install manually:

```bash
pip install torchaudio transformers librosa matplotlib ipython
```

### 3. Run the Notebook

Open the notebook using Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook project_1_Speech_to_Text_for_transcription_services.ipynb
```

Follow the instructions in the notebook to upload audio files and generate transcriptions.

## üìÑ Output

* Transcribed text is displayed directly in the notebook
* Intermediate steps like waveform and spectrogram visualization are included

## ‚úÖ Future Improvements

* Add support for batch processing
* Integrate with a web API for real-time transcription
* Include speaker diarization
